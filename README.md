# Python-Games
This is a beginner Python game project created to practice programming fundamentals, improve logic-building skills, and start my journey into game development.

hello This is The Read ME file for explaination of code :

<details>
<summary><b>1. Rock Paper Scissor (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

like for bold print you can use  
\033[1m → turns bold ON  
\033[0m → resets formatting  
( resets formatting in simple language if you didnt reset by this all the text will be in bold ) 

example : print("\033[1 mThis is bold text \033[0m")

I used Random for choices you can import it will just pop the random things from list for no. or else  
you can refer the https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-random-module/

<summary><b>2. Dice Roller (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

This is a simple dice rolling game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 6, just like rolling a real dice.  
The game keeps running until the user chooses to exit.

I used Python's random module to generate numbers.  
It selects a number using `random.randint(1,6)` which simulates a dice roll.
