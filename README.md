# Python-Games
This is a beginner Python game project created to practice programming fundamentals, improve logic-building skills, and start my journey into game development.

hello This is The Read ME file for explaination of code :

<details>
<summary><b>1. Rock Paper Scissor (Click to Expand)</b></summary>
“I used .lower() on the input to convert all letters to lowercase.”
  
## To print the text in BOLD i used this : 
\033[1m → turns bold ON  
\033[0m → resets formatting  
( resets formatting in simple language if you didnt reset by this all the text will be in bold ) 

example : print("\033[1 mThis is bold text \033[0m")

I used Random for choices you can import it will just pop the random things from list or no's or else  
you can refer the https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-random-module/

<summary><b>2. Dice Roller (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

This is a simple dice rolling game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 6, just like rolling a real dice.  
The game keeps running until the user chooses to exit.

I used Python's random module to generate numbers.  
It selects a number using `random.randint(1,6)` which simulates a dice roll.

<summary><b>3. Computer Quiz Game (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

This is a simple Python quiz game, 
The program randomly selects a question from a list and removes it after asking, so questions never repeat.  

The user types an answer, and the program checks whether it is correct or not.  
If the answer is wrong, the correct answer is shown.  
The quiz continues until all questions are completed or the user exits.

This project demonstrates the use of:
- Lists and tuples
- Random module
- Loops and conditions
- User input handling
